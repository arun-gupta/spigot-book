[[Managing_your_server_with_CraftBukkit]]
== Managing your CraftBukkit server

Part I of this book explained how to start your own Bukkit server and install plugins in it. The commands were simple and easy to understand. However you feel the need of taking control of your server and managing it more efficiently. This chapter will refresh the introduction to Bukkit and CraftBukkit and the difference between them. It will also explain how to run a Minecraft server using CraftBukkit and show basic commands for managing the server.

=== Bukkit API

Bukkit is a free, open-source, software project that provide the means to extend Minecraft multiplayer servers. It is neither the official modding Application Programming Interface (API) nor supported by Mojang, yet. However it is one of the most popular way to build server-side plugins, which are plugins that only work on servers. That means you cannot change any client-side functionality using Bukkit.

.What is the difference between mods and plugins?
****
Mods involve __modifying__ the source code of Minecraft to do something or add additional functionality. Plugins are extra software that __plug__ into an application, instead of modifying the source code. Mods generally provide a framework that recognize plugins built using that framework. This makes mod free-standing, while plugins are generally built on the framework provided by mods.

For example, CraftBukkit is a modded Minecraft server that recognizes plugins built using Bukkit API.
****

The ``vanilla'' or un-modded server as downloaded from http://minecraft.net does not understand the plugins built using Bukkit API. CraftBukkit is a ``modified'' or ``modded'' server that does understand this API. It is available for download at https://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/ at no cost at all. So plugin builders use Bukkit API to build _plugins_ and install them on their CraftBukkit server.

.What is the difference between Bukkit and CraftBukkit?
****
Bukkit is the API used by developers to make plugins. CraftBukkit is the modded Minecraft server that understands plugins built using Bukkit API.
****

Multiple plugins with different functionalities can be easily installed on CraftBukkit server. Multiple clients can then connect to this server and all use the same plugins as shown in <<Bukkit_plugins>>.

This book will teach you how to build Bukkit plugins and install them on CraftBukkit server.

[[Which_CraftBukkit_Build_to_use]]
=== Which CraftBukkit build to use ?

CraftBukkit can be downloaded from https://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/. It is typically available in three different builds:

- Recommended
- Beta
- Development

These builds differ in terms of what version of Minecraft is supported and what items, blocks, and entities can be changed. For example, the support at the time of this writing is shown in <<Bukkit_Builds>>.

[[Bukkit_Builds]]
.Bukkit Builds
[width="50%"]
|====
| Build | Version

| Recommended | 1.6.4-R2.0
| Beta | 1.7.9-R0.2
| Development | 1.7.10-R0.1
|====

Each version is split into two parts, separated by a `-`. The first part indicates the supported Minecraft version. Multiple releases are made for each build as new functionality is added. The second part indicates the release number for that particular build. The first release for a build is typically labeled 0.1 and generally incremented by 0.1 with each release.

At the time of this writing, the `Recommended' build is most stable and tested with Minecraft 1.6.4. `Development' is where support for the latest Minecraft version is available, 1.7.10 in this case. As you can imagine, all the latest and cool features are added here first and so there might be some bugs with this build. `Beta' build is in between `Recommended' and `Development' and can be used if a more recent Minecraft version server is needed but with some stability.

[[Running_CraftBukkit_Server]]
=== Run a CraftBukkit server

Most of the publicly available Minecraft servers use Bukkit, because it is an easy solution to problems like world protection and minigame making. World protection is making sure certain players can't break blocks in certain areas. For example, you could specify that only you and people you trust can break blocks at your spawn area. Minigames are a fun part of some servers. They include things like Player vs. Player arenas where you fight with other players and Spleef arenas where you try to break blocks underneath other players. Some Bukkit plugins allow you to easily create miningames like that and make sure that they can't be broken or exploited.

There are so many plugins for Bukkit (over 10,000) that it can do pretty much anything! You can find all of these plugins at http://plugins.bukkit.org/.

It is extremely easy to install a Bukkit server, and very easy to install plugins after that. To do this, first go to https://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/ and download one of the CraftBukkit builds. The recommended build is usually the most bug-free, and would probably be the best choice. The build is downloaded as a JAR file and server can be easily started using the command shown in <<Starting_CraftBukkit_Server>>.

[[Starting_CraftBukkit_Server]]

As of this writing 1.6.4-R2.0 is the recommended build but we'll be using the beta build 1.7.9-R0.2 so that more recent functionality of the game can be used. So the command to start the server for us is shown in <<Starting_CraftBukkit_179_Server>>.

.Starting the server in a separate directory
[TIP]
====
It is strongly recommended to copy this JAR file to a new directory and then start the server. This is because starting the server will generate a bunch of files and directories and this will keep your changes contained in a single directory. 
====

Starting the server shows output in <<CraftBukkit_server_log>>.

It also opens up the Minecraft console for giving any commands on the server. Your output may look slightly different based upon the version of JAR file. Lets understand what happened during server startup.

<1> This line tells you which version of Minecraft you are running. In this case, it is version 1.7.9.
<2> Tries to load `server.properties` file. This file stores all the settings for a multiplayer server (very self-explanatory!) using `name=value` format where `name` is the name of the property and `value` is the value of the property. For example, `max-players=20` define the maximum number of players that can play on the server at the same time. The property name is fixed and the property values can be edited. Any changes to this file require a server restart or reload. Some other properties that it includes, but is not limited to, whether the nether is allowed, whether command blocks are allowed, and whether generated structures appear in the world.
+
Complete list of properties and an explanation of their values that can be specified in this file are explained at http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Server.properties.
+
<3> Indicates that the file can not be found. This is expected because we are running in a directory with no prior contents.
<4> This line indicates that the server is creating a new `server.properties` file. Subsequent runs of the server will reuse this file.
<5> Defines the gamemode to be creative, survival, hardcore, or spectator. The default mode is surival.
<6> Shows the port on which Minecraft is running. By default, Minecraft starts on port 25565. It can be started on a different port as shown in <<Running_Minecraft_on_a_different_port>>.

Operator, also known as moderator, is a player who can moderate a multiplayer server. Operators have access to a variety server commands that allow them to keep control of the server.

The values specified on the command line when starting the server override the values specified in `server.properties` file. For example, Bukkit servers require an Internet connection to authenticate usernames with Mojang. By default, the game cannot be played if there is no Internet connection. However the server can be started in an `offline' mode where this authentication is disabled. Typically players will set the `offline-mode` property to `false` in `server.properties` to run the server in offline mode. Now this can alternatively be achieved by running the server as shown in <<Start_Bukkit_server_in_offline_mode>>.

[[Manage_CraftBukkit_Server]]
=== Manage a CraftBukkit Server

Several commands are available to manage your CraftBukkit server. Some of them are explained below. 

The server can be stopped by giving the `stop` command in the console as shown in <<Stop_CraftBukkit_server>>.

[[Stop_CraftBukkit_server]]
.Stop CraftBukkit server
====
[source,text]
----
[13:31:14 INFO]: CONSOLE: Stopping the server.
[13:31:14 INFO]: Stopping server
[13:31:14 INFO]: Saving players
[13:31:14 INFO]: Saving worlds

[13:31:14 INFO]: Saving chunks for level 'world_the_end'/The End
[13:31:14 INFO]: Stopping server
----
====

All the plugins can be reloaded by giving the `reload` command in the console as shown in <<Reload_plugins_and_CraftBukkit_server_configuration>>. There is no need to stop and restart the server in this case. In addition, this also loads `permissions.yml` which define the permissions assigned to each player.

[[Reload_plugins_and_CraftBukkit_server_configuration]]
.Reload plugins and CraftBukkit server configuration

[source,text]
----
>reload
[13:31:30 INFO]: Server permissions file permissions.yml is empty, ignoring it
[13:31:30 INFO]: CONSOLE: Reload complete.
----
====

The log message indicate that the server does not have any `permissions.yml` file and so no permissions are assigned to any user yet. Also, no plugins have been installed in the server yet and so no message is shown for them. Later chapters will show more detailed messages when the server is reloaded with plugins installed.

The complete list of commands can be seen by typing `help` in the console and see the output as shown in <<CraftBukkit_help_command>>.

More details about each command can be obtained by typing `help <COMMAND NAME>` in the console. Complete list of commands is also explained at http://wiki.bukkit.org/CraftBukkit_Commands.

Does it feel powerful to run your own Minecraft server? Make yourself more powerful by becoming an ``operator''. To do this, give the `op` command as shown in <<Making_a_player_an_operator>>.

[[Bukkit_documentation]]
=== Bukkit documentation

The documentation for any Java API is available in HTML format, and is called a __javadoc__. For example, the javadocs for all Java APIs are available at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/.

Javadocs for all Bukkit builds are available at http://jd.bukkit.org. Javadocs for the latest beta build (1.7.9-R0.2 as of this writing) are at http://jd.bukkit.org/beta/apidocs/ and shown in <<Bukkit_Javadocs>>.

[[Bukkit_Javadocs]]
.Bukkit Javadocs
image::images/bukkit-beta-javadocs.png["Bukkit Javadocs"]

The page is divided in three sections. The top left section shows all Java packages in the API, bottom left section shows all classes in all the packages, and right section shows the documentation for the selected package or class. You'll learn about Java packages and classes in <<Getting_Started_with_Java>>.

The usual flow will be to select a package in the top left section, which shows all classes in that package in the bottom left section. Then selecting a class in the bottom left section shows documentation for that class in the right section. For example, <<Bukkit_Entity_Event_Javadocs>> shows `org.bukkit.event.entity` package is selected on the top left, classes in that package are shown in the bottom left, and `EntityEvent` class documentation is shown in the right section.

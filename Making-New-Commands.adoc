[[Making_New_Commands]]
== Making New Commands

Have you ever wanted to add new commands to Minecraft? With Bukkit, you can do that. In this chapter, we will learn how to add new commands to the game. 

First, we will make a plugin that adds a command that summons any number of pigs where you are. The pigs will be on fire, to add to the fun. Then, we will make a more complicated plugin that utilizes both commands and a Listener to change the mob that spawns when an egg hits the ground.

=== Flaming Pigs

Pigs aren't normally on fire. The only way to ignite them is to push them into a fire block or into lava. The first plugin will add a command that lets you spawn whatever number you want of pigs that are all on fire. It isn't really very useful, just funny to see a bunch of pigs on fire.

==== Create the plugin

Like all other plugins, the Bukkit Archetype will be used to create this plugin. The information that you enter should look like the information in <<FlamingPigs_Plugin_Creation>>.

[[FlamingPigs_Plugin_Creation]]
.FlamingPigs plugin information
image::images/netbeans-create-plugin-flaming-pigs.png[]

Click on ``Finish'' to create the plugin.

The directory structure, not expanded, should look like <<FlamingPigs_Directory_Structure>>.

[[FlamingPigs_Directory_Structure]]
.FlamingPigs directory structure
image::images/netbeans-create-plugin-flaming-pigs-directory-structure.png[]

When you open the ``Source Packages'', ``Other Sources'', and ``Project Files'' packages, it should look like as shown in <<FlamingPigs_Expanded_Directory_Structure>>.

[[FlamingPigs_Expanded_Directory_Structure]]
.FlamingPigs expanded directory structure
image::images/netbeans-create-plugin-flaming-pigs-directory-structure-expanded.png[]

A Listener is not required for this plugin, as commands are not registered in a Listener. Instead, you register them in `plugin.yml` and define what they do in `MyPlugin.java`.

==== Register the command

First, we will register the command in `plugin.yml`. The file should currently look like <<FlamingPigs_plugin_yml>>.

[[FlamingPigs_plugin_yml]]
.FlamingPigs plugin.yml
====
[source, yaml]
----
name: FlamingPigs
version: "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
author: Aditya Gupta
main: org.devoxx4kids.bukkit.plugins.flamingpigs.MyPlugin
----
====

The code you will have to add is pretty simple. It looks like <<FlamingPigs_Registering_Command>>, and should be added at the end of the file.

[[FlamingPigs_Registering_Command]]
.Register the flamingpigs command
====
[source, yaml]
----
commands: <1>
  flamingpigs: <2>
    description: spawn a certain number of flaming pigs where you are, which are on fire for 30 seconds. <3>
    usage: /flamingpigs <number of pigs> <4>
    aliases: fp <5>
----
====

[NOTE]
====
YAML is a simple, easy to understand language used commonly in configuration files. It uses spaces and indents to categorize different items.
====

There are a few important things in this file:

<1> `commands:` denotes the start of the commands category, in which new commands can be registered. Since the word `flamingpigs:` is after `commands:`, and is one indent level after `commands:`, it is in the commands category.
<2> `flamingpigs:` registers a command called ``flamingpigs''.
<3> `description:` has the description of the plugin that is shown when a player types the command `/help <command>`.
<4> `usage:` is how the command is meant to be used. It is also shown when a player types `/help <command>`.
<5> `aliases:` lists what other commands shold be created that do exactly the same thing as the first command. Adding `fp` after this makes the command `/fp` do the same thing as `/flamingpigs`. To add multiple aliases, separate them with commas and put them in brackets. For example, `aliases: [fp, firepigs]` would register `/fp` and `/firepigs` as aliases.

Your `plugin.yml` file should now look like <<FlamingPigs_Finished_plugin_yml>>.

[[FlamingPigs_Finished_plugin_yml]]

    usage: /flamingpigs <number of pigs>
    aliases: fp
----

==== Add command functionality

Now your command is registered, but it doesn't do anything. Functionality can be added in `MyPlugin.java`. It should look like <<FlamingPigs_MyPlugin_java>>.

[[FlamingPigs_MyPlugin_java]]
.FlamingPigs MyPlugin.java
====
[source, java]
----
package org.devoxx4kids.bukkit.plugins.flamingpigs;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    // This code is called after the server starts and after the /reload command
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        getLogger().log(Level.INFO, "{0}.onEnable()", 
            this.getClass().getName());
    }

    // This code is called before the server stops and after the /reload command
    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        getLogger().log(Level.INFO, "{0}.onDisable()",
            this.getClass().getName());
    }
}
----
====

You will have to add the method in <<FlamingPigs_onCommand_Method>> to `MyPlugin.java` so that the command functions properly. The method is called when a command is run.

[[FlamingPigs_onCommand_Method]]
.FlamingPigs onCommand method
====
[source, java]
----
	@Override <1>
    public boolean onCommand(CommandSender sender, Command cmd, String label, String[] args) { <2>
        if (cmd.getName().equals("flamingpigs")) {<3>
        	return false;
        } 
        if (!(sender instanceof Player)) { <4>
            return false;
        }

        if (args.length != 1) { <5>
            sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.DARK_RED + cmd.getUsage()); <6>
            return false;
        }

        Location location = ((Player) sender).getLocation(); <7>
            
        int numberOfPigs;

        try { <8>
            numberOfPigs = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        } catch (NumberFormatException nfe){
            sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + args[1] + 
                ChatColor.DARK_RED + " is not a valid number!");
            return false;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < numberOfPigs; i++){ <9>
            Entity pig = ((Player) sender).getWorld() <10>
                .spawnEntity(location, EntityType.PIG);
            pig.setFireTicks(6000); <11>
        }  
        return true; <12>
    }
----
====

This method uses many Java concepts, and there are many important things in it:

<1> The `@Override` annotation means that this method will override the same method in `JavaPlugin`, which this file extends to.
<2> This method has four paramaters - The player/command block/console that issued the command (`CommandSender sender`), The command itself (`Command cmd`), the alias of the command that was used (`String label`), and the arguments given to the command (`String[] args`).
<3> This ``if'' statement makes sure that the code underneath is only run if the command's name is `flamingpigs` or one of its aliases. If the command is not `flamingpigs`, the method will return a value of `false` and stop running.
<4> This ``if'' statement makes sure that the command can only be run by a player. `instanceof` is a Java keyword that checks if an object is a certain type. In this case, it is used to check if `sender` is a player. The command could also be run by a command block or the server console, but we want only players to be able to do the command.
<5> This ``if'' statement makes sure that only one argument is passed, because any additional arguments are meaningful for this plugin. If you were to add more arguments, you would change this line.
<6> If the above ``if'' statement returned false, this line sends a message to the player colored dark red that tells them the proper usage of the command.
<7> This line gets the location of the command's sender and stores it in a variable called `location`. `((Player) sender)` is an example of __casting__, which allows a Java class to use functionality from another compatible class, such as the parent class. Here, since `sender` is of the type Player, you can cast it to Player and use Player's methods with `sender`. If the object being casted is not the same type as what it is being casted to, the casting will not work.
<8> This line stores the number of pigs specified by the player in a variable. `args[0]` gets the first object in the list `args`. In Java, when you are getting items from a list, the first item is at index 0, so we are getting the first thing from `args`.
+
The `Integer.parseInt()` method can turn a String into an Integer, and we are using it to turn the String from `args` into an Integer. This variable is called `numberOfPigs`.
+
The `try` and `catch` blocks are used to catch Java __exceptions__. An exception is thrown when something goes wrong. Each exception is a class name. In this case, the exception name is `java.lang.NumberFormatException`, which is thrown when a String cannot be converted into an Integer. The second argument must be an integer, because we want a number of pigs. If the argument cannot be turned into an Integer, the exception is created and thrown. The player who ran the command is notified that the number they put in is invalid.
+
<9> This line is the beginning of a __for loop__. A for loop consists of three parts. The first part initializes a variable. The second part tells when the loop should stop. The last part tells how much the variable increments or decrements each time the loop runs. Each of these values is separated by a semicolon.
+
In the statement `int i = 0; i < numberOfPigs; i++`, the first part (`int i = 0`) initializes a new integer variable called `i` with a value of 0. The second part tells that the loop should keep running as long as the variable `i` is less than the variable ``numberOfPigs`. The third part tells that the variable `i` should be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. When you put a `++` after a variable, it increments it by 1 after the statement it's in is run. If you put `++` before a variable, it is incremented before its statement is run.
+
<10> This line spawns a pig entity at the sender's location and world. It also stores the entity in a variable called `pig`.
<11> This line sets the pig on fire for 6000 ticks, which is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes.
<12> This line returns a value of `true`. It will only run if the command was executed successfully.

==== Build and install the plugin

Like the other plugins, you will have to build the plugin before it can be used. If it successfully builds, it should output the message in <<Building_FlamingPigs>>.

Restart your server and try out the new command! One fun thing you can do with it is fly up into the air about 10 blocks and type in the command in <<FlamingPigs_Command>>.

200 pigs will drop down and they will take damage from falling. When they drop, they will spread out. Since they are on fire, they will die in a few seconds. When they die, the particles created from their deaths will make a ``cloud''. <<FlamingPigs_Cloud>> shows a picture of the ``cloud''.

[[FlamingPigs_Cloud]]

If you spawn pigs on the ground and they are running around crazily, they probably look something like <<FlamingPigs>>.

=== Throw Egg

This plugin is more practical. When you right-click with an egg item, it gets thrown, and on landing, it has a 12.5% chance of spawning a baby chicken. This plugin will add a command that controls what spawns when the egg lands, so instead of chickens, it could spawn zombies, pigs, or whatever you want it to. You can also configure how many of that mob will be spawned.

==== Create the plugin

Now that you know how to add a new command, this next plugin will utilize commands and a Listener to change what spawns when an egg lands on the ground. First of all, like all other plugins, use the Bukkit Archetype to create a new plugin. The information should look like <<ThrowEgg_Plugin_Information>>.

[[ThrowEgg_Plugin_Information]]

The directory structure, not expanded, should look like <<ThrowEgg_Directory_Structure>>.

When you open the ``Source Packages'', ``Other Sources'', and ``Project Files'' packages, it should look like as shown in <<ThrowEgg_Expanded_Directory_Structure>>.

[[ThrowEgg_Expanded_Directory_Structure]]

==== Register the command

Like the last plugin, you will need to register a new command in `plugin.yml`. The new code for registering the command looks like <<ThrowEgg_Registering_Command>> and will be added to the end of the file.

[[ThrowEgg_Registering_Command]]

====

==== Add command functionality

Now, like the last plugin, the command is registered, but doesn't do anything. Functionality will have to be added in `MyPlugin.java`.

First of all, some variables will need to be added. These will store the entity and number of entities chosen when a player runs the command. These variables are shown in <<ThrowEgg_Variables_To_Add>>

[[ThrowEgg_Variables_To_Add]]
.Variables to add in ThrowEgg MyPlugin.java
====
[source, java]
----
public static EntityType entityType; <1>
public static int numberOfEntities; <2>
----
====
<1> This variable stores an `EntityType`, which is a type defined by Bukkit. It is used in methods that spawn entities to determine what entity should be spawned.
<2> This variable is an integer variable that will store the number of entities that should be spawned.

These variables do not have any use right now, so code will have to be added to use them. This code is shown in <<ThrowEgg_Command_Method>> and should be written at the end of the file.

[[ThrowEgg_Command_Method]]
.ThrowEgg command method
====
[source, java]
----
@Override
public boolean onCommand(CommandSender sender, <1>
                         Command cmd, 
                         String label, 
                         String[] args) { 
    if (!(cmd.getName().equals("eggconfig"))) { <2>
        return false;
    }
    if (args.length != 2) { <3>
        sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.DARK_RED + cmd.getUsage()); 
        return false;
    }
    
    try{ <4>
        entityType = EntityType.valueOf(args[0]
                                        .toString()
                                        .toUpperCase());
    } catch (NullPointerException npe){
        sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + 
            entityType.toString() + ChatColor.DARK_RED + 
            " is not a valid entity!");
        return false;
    }
    
    try{ <5>
        numberOfEntities = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
    } catch (NumberFormatException nfe){
        sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.RED + args[1] 
            + ChatColor.DARK_RED + " is not a valid number!");
        return false;
    }
    
    sender.sendMessage(ChatColor.GREEN + "Eggs will now hatch " <6>
        + numberOfEntities + " " + entityType + "(s)."); 
    
    return true; <7>
}
----
====

This code has a few important parts in it:

<1> Like the last plugin, this method is the `onCommand()` method used for commands.
<2> If the command is not `eggconfig` or one of its aliases, this method will return a value of false.
<3> This time, the code is checking for two arguments instead of one because it needs the entity type and the number of entities.
+
Notice that the ``if'' statement checking for the sender being a player is now gone. This is because the command does not use locations, which means the server console or a command block could use the command.
+
<4> The first argument is turned into all uppercase letters because `EntityType` variables are always in uppercase. Then, it is turned into an `EntityType` with the `EntityType.valueOf()` method and stored in the `entityType` variable. If a `NullPointerException` is caught, that means the method returned `null` because the given String is not a valid entity. The player is notified that their input is invalid, and the method returns `false`.
<5> The second argument is turned into an integer with the `Integer.parseInt()` method and stored in the `numberOfEntities` variable. It is handled the same way as `numberOfPigs` in the previous plugin. If a `NumberFormatException` is caught, the player is notified that their input is invalid and the method returns `false`.
<6> The command issuer is sent a message telling them what eggs will hatch and how many of that entity will be hatched.
<7> If the command ran successfully, the method will return a value of true.

Now, the command sets the variables to whatever the player inputs. The variables' values still are not used anywhere, so a Listener will have to be added. The Listener will check for a chicken being hatched from an egg and change the chicken to the entity in `entityType`.

==== Register and create the Listener

In `MyPlugin.java`, add a line in the `onEnable()` method that looks like <<ThrowEgg_Register_Listener>> to register the Listener.

[[ThrowEgg_Register_Listener]]
.Register the ThrowEgg Listener
====
[source, java]
----
getServer().getPluginManager()
    .registerEvents(new EggListener(), this);
----
====

Click on the stop sign next to this line and select the option shown in <<ThrowEgg_Create_Listener>>.

[[ThrowEgg_Create_Listener]]
.Create the ThrowEgg Listener
image::images/netbeans-create-plugin-throw-egg-create-listener.png[]

==== Add event handlers

First of all, delete the constructor in the Listener. The constructor looks like <<ThrowEgg_Listener_Constructor>>.

[[ThrowEgg_Listener_Constructor]]
.ThrowEgg Listener constructor
====
[source, java]
----
public EggListener() {
}
----
====

The code in <<ThrowEgg_Listener_Method>> will have to be added into the Listener for it to work.

[[ThrowEgg_Listener_Method]]
.ThrowEgg Listener method
====
[source, java]
----
@EventHandler
public void hatchEntity(CreatureSpawnEvent event) { <1>
    Entity entity = event.getEntity(); <2>
    Location location = entity.getLocation();
    World world = entity.getWorld();

    if (event.getSpawnReason() == SpawnReason.EGG <3>
    && event.getEntityType() == EntityType.CHICKEN) {
        entity.remove(); <4>
        for (int i = 0 ; i < MyPlugin.numberOfEntities ; i++) { <5>
            world.spawnEntity(location, MyPlugin.entityType); <6>
        }
    }
}
----
====

There are some important things in this code:

<1> This method is run when a entity spawns (`CreatureSpawnEvent`) In this case, we will be using it to check for a chicken spwaning from a thrown eggs.
<2> The entity spawned, its location, and its world are stored in variables called `entity`, `location`, and `world`, respectively.
<3> The method only continues if the entity spawned was a chicken and it spawned from a thrown egg.
<4> The chicken is removed from the world.
<5> This for loop runs for the amount of times specified in `numberOfEntities`.
<6> An entity is spawned at the location of the now dead chicken, and its type matches the type in `entityType`.

==== Build and install the plugin

Now, you can build the plugin and restart your server to install it. Use the command in <<ThrowEgg_Command>> to change what the egg spawns.

[[ThrowEgg_Command]]
.ThrowEgg command
====
[source, text]
----
/ec <entity type> <number of entities>
----
====

Some fun things you can do are:

. Make the egg spawn 100 BAT and make a ``bat cloud''
. Make the egg spawn 1 PRIMED_TNT and make explosive eggs
. Make the egg spawn 100 ZOMBIE and make a zombie apocalypse

There are lots of fun things you can do with this plugin!

<<ThrowEgg_Command_Output>> shows the output that comes when you do the command.

[[ThrowEgg_Command_Output]]
.ThrowEgg command output
image::images/netbeans-create-plugin-throw-egg-minecraft-output.png[]

The player set eggs to hatch 5 ZOMBIEs, 50 BATs, and 17 WITCHes.

=== Summary

This chapter taught you how to make new commands in the game. First, you made a command that lets you spawn any number of flaming pigs where you are. Next, you made a command that lets you configure what a thrown egg should hatch when it hits the ground. It utilized both commands and a Listener. In the next chapter, you will learn how to make new structures with plugins.
